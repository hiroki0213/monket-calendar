# About #

Monket Calendar is coded in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. It is based on the premise of providing an Apple iCal style interface that is available wherever you are. The interface has been designed to make it as easy as possible to add/change/remove events and thereby reduce the frustration of using the browser for entering and managing data.

The layout of the events is also important, Monket Calendar is one of the only web based calendars can displays multi-day events spanning accross the days on which they occur (Plans Calendar is the only other one I've seen). This spanning of events makes it much easier to read the calendar at a glance.

I made extensive use of exisitng libraries to speed up my development work, including:

  * PHPiCalendar for parsing .ics files
  * DataRequestor for Ajax calls
  * ie7 for Internet Explorer compataibility
  * DOM-Drag for javascript drag and drop support
  * DOM Tooltop for javascript tooltip support
